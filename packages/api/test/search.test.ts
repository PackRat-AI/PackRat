// Note: These search routes are not implemented in the API.
// The API uses distributed search functionality:
// - Guides search: /api/guides/search
// - Catalog search: /api/catalog/vector-search
// - Weather search: /api/weather/search
// - Admin search: /api/admin/*-search endpoints
// 
// The tests expect centralized /api/search/* routes that don't exist.
