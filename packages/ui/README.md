## UI Kit

Note we're following the [design systems guide](https://tamagui.dev/docs/guides/design-systems) and creating our own package for components.

We're using @tamagui/build to build this package, which is a small script built around esbuild and typescript that makes sure you output your components with JSX preserved.

See `packages/ui` named `@packrat/ui` for how this works.
