# Gear Gap Analysis

The Gear Gap Analysis feature helps outdoor enthusiasts identify missing essential items for their planned adventures. By analyzing a user's current pack contents against activity-specific essential gear lists, the feature provides personalized recommendations to ensure users are properly equipped for their outdoor activities.

## Overview

Gear Gap Analysis is a smart analysis tool that:
- Evaluates your current pack contents against essential items for specific outdoor activities
- Identifies missing gear categorized by priority level (Essential, Recommended, Optional)
- Provides completion percentage and summary statistics
- Offers alternatives for required items
- Helps ensure safety and preparedness for outdoor adventures

## Supported Activity Types

The system supports analysis for the following outdoor activity types:

### Day Hiking
Essential items for day hikes including navigation, safety equipment, hydration, and basic supplies.

### Backpacking
Multi-day hiking essentials including shelter, sleep systems, cooking equipment, and extended safety gear.

### Camping
Car camping and campground essentials focused on comfort and convenience.

### Climbing
Rock climbing and mountaineering safety equipment including ropes, harnesses, protection, and specialized gear.

### Winter Sports
Cold weather and snow activity essentials including insulation, traction aids, and winter safety equipment.

### Desert Adventures
Hot weather and desert-specific gear including extra water, sun protection, and heat management.

### Water Sports
Kayaking, rafting, and water activity safety equipment including personal flotation devices and waterproof gear.

### Skiing
Alpine and backcountry skiing equipment including skis, safety gear, and avalanche equipment.

### Custom Activities
General outdoor essentials for custom or mixed activities.

## How It Works

### 1. Activity Selection
Users select the type of outdoor activity they're planning from a visual grid of activity types.

### 2. Pack Analysis
The system analyzes the user's current pack contents and compares them against a comprehensive database of essential items for the selected activity.

### 3. Gap Identification
Missing items are identified using smart matching that considers:
- Exact item name matches
- Alternative item names (e.g., "Down Jacket" matches "Insulated Jacket")
- Category-based matching
- Keyword-based partial matching

### 4. Results Display
Results are presented with:
- **Completion Percentage**: Overall pack completeness score
- **Priority Breakdown**: Count of missing items by priority level
- **Categorized Missing Items**: Items grouped by category and priority
- **Item Details**: Descriptions and alternatives for each missing item

## Priority Levels

### Essential
Items that are critical for safety and basic functionality. Missing essential items pose significant safety risks.

### Recommended
Items that greatly enhance safety, comfort, or functionality. Highly recommended for most conditions.

### Optional
Items that provide additional comfort or convenience but are not critical for the activity.
