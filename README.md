</div>

## Features 🚀

- Create and manage trips: users can create new trips and manage existing ones by adding details such as dates, locations, and activities.
- Map integration: PackRat integrates with Mapbox to provide users with accurate maps and directions to their destinations.
- Activity suggestions: the app suggests popular outdoor activities based on the location and season of the trip.
- Packing list: users can create and manage packing lists for their trips to ensure they have everything they need.
- Weather forecast: PackRat provides up-to-date weather forecasts for the trip location to help users prepare accordingly.
- User authentication: the app uses user authentication to ensure privacy and data security.

## Technologies used 💻

PackRat is built using the following technologies:

- React Native: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Expo: a set of tools and services for building and deploying React Native applications.
- MongoDB: a document-oriented database program.
- Express.js: a web application framework for Node.js.
- Node.js: an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment.
- Redux: a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- Mapbox: a location data platform for mobile and web applications.

## 🗂 Folder layout

The main apps are:

- `expo` (native, web)
- `next` (ssr web) -- not yet implemented

- `packages` shared packages across apps
  - `ui` includes your custom UI kit that will be optimized by Tamagui
  - `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
    - `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
    - `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)

## UI Kit

Note we're following the [design systems guide](https://tamagui.dev/docs/guides/design-systems) and creating our own package for components.

See `packages/ui` named `@my/ui` for how this works.

## 🆕 Add new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

If you're installing a JavaScript-only dependency that will be used across platforms, install it in `packages/app`:

```sh
cd packages/app
yarn add date-fns
cd ../..
yarn
```

### Native dependencies

If you're installing a library with any native code, you must install it in `expo`:

```sh
cd apps/expo
yarn add react-native-reanimated
cd ..
yarn
```

## Update new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

```sh
yarn upgrade-interactive
```

You can also install the native library inside of `packages/app` if you want to get autoimport for that package inside of the `app` folder. However, you need to be careful and install the _exact_ same version in both packages. If the versions mismatch at all, you'll potentially get terrible bugs. This is a classic monorepo issue. I use `lerna-update-wizard` to help with this (you don't need to use Lerna to use that lib).

You may potentially want to have the native module transpiled for the next app. If you get error messages with `Cannot use import statement outside a module`, you may need to use `transpilePackages` in your `next.config.js` and add the module to the array there.

## Local installation 📲

PackRat consists of two main components: a client and a server. Follow the steps below to install and run both components.

### Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/)
- [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   HTTPS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrew-bierman/PackRat.git
```

SSH:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:andrew-bierman/PackRat.git
```

2. Navigate to the `PackRat` directory:

```
cd PackRat
```

3. Set up the environment variables for the client and server.
   - If you have access to the development env files, use those. Otherwise, replace the values with your own.
   - See the `.env.example` files in the `client` and `server` directories for the necessary environment variables.

#### Automated Setup 🛠️

1. Run the setup script from the `PackRat` directory.
```
yarn setup
```

#### Manual Setup 📝

1. Navigate to the `PackRat` directory if you are not already there.

2. Navigate to the `client` directory.

```
cd client
```

- Note that for the client to run, you need to also make the following changes:
     - Copy the `app.example.json` file and rename it to `app.json`. Open the file and replace the `MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN_FROM_ENV` value with your own Mapbox API key.
     - Navigate to the ios directory. Copy the `Podfile.example` file and rename it to `Podfile`. Open the file and replace the `MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN_FROM_ENV` value with your own Mapbox access token.
     - Navigate to the android directory. Copy the `gradle.properties.example` file and rename it to `gradle.properties`. Open the file and replace the `MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN_FROM_ENV` value with your own Mapbox downloads token.
     - See the [Mapbox documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/) for more information on how to obtain Mapbox API keys and access tokens.

2. Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Open the file and replace the values with your own.
   - If you have access to the development env file, skip this step. Otherwise, replace the values with your own.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

1. Duplicate the `app.example.json` file and rename it to `app.json`. Open the file and replace the `MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN_FROM_ENV` value with your own Mapbox API key.

```
cp app.example.json app.json
```

4. Navigate to the ios directory.

```
cd ios
```

5. Duplicate the `Podfile.example` file and rename it to `Podfile`. Open the file and replace the `MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN_FROM_ENV` value with your own Mapbox access token.

```
cp Podfile.example Podfile
```

6. Navigate to the android directory.

```
cd ../android

```

7. Duplicate the `gradle.properties.example` file and rename it to `gradle.properties`. Open the file and replace the `MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN_FROM_ENV` value with your own Mapbox downloads token.

```
cp gradle.properties.example gradle.properties
```

- Note, for the replacement steps, these replaced values should now be strings with the mapbox secret key for download token, in the following format:

```
"sk..."
```


1. Navigate back to the `PackRat` directory.

```
cd ../..
```

9. Navigate to the `server` directory.

```
cd server
```

10. Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Open the file and replace the values with your own.
        - If you have access to the development env file, skip this step. Otherwise, replace the values with your own.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

1.  Navigate back to the `PackRat` directory.

```
cd ..
```

### Yarn Setup

Recommended to open two terminal windows.

#### Root

1.  From the main`PackRat` directory.

```
yarn install
```


#### Server

1. Navigate to the `server` directory.

```
cd server
```

2. Start the server.

```
yarn start
```

#### Client

1. Navigate to the `client` directory.

```
cd client
```

2. Start the Expo server.

```
yarn start
```

4. Here you will be able to run the app on an iOS or Android simulator (or on your own device), or on the web. See the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/) for more information on how to set up your development environment.

Note that the client and server are designed to run concurrently in development mode.


### Debugging Yarn Environment Setup - Windows

**Check yarn and node version:**
```
yarn -v
```
```
node -v
```

**If node version < 18.0.0:**
- Update to latest: https://nodejs.org/en/download

**If yarn version >= 4.0.0:**
- Skip this process

**If you don't have yarn installed:**
- Run command prompt as an administrator
- Run `(corepack comes along with node js 18+)`
  ```
  corepack enable
  ```
- Run
  ```
  yarn set version stable
  ```
- Run
  ```
  yarn install
  ```
- Check yarn version(`yarn -v`): *version >= 4.0.2*
- Restart your code editor if opened

**If yarn version < 4.0.0:**
- Make sure you're using Node 18+
- Go to your windows root path  (`C:\Users\HP)`
- Delete any `.yarnrc.yml` file and `.yarn` folder
- Delete `yarn` folder from `C:\Program Files (x86)`
- Run command prompt as an administrator
- Run `(corepack comes along with node js 18+)`
  ```
  corepack enable
  ```
- Go into the project directory `cd \PackRat`
- Run
  ```
  yarn set version stable
  ```
- Run
  ```
  yarn install
  ```
- Restart your code editor if opened
- If you any encounter errors, try restarting your system.
