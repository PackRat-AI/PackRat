# Leave No Trace: Principles for Ethical Outdoor Recreation

As outdoor recreation continues to grow in popularity, our collective impact on natural areas increases. The Leave No Trace (LNT) principles provide a framework for minimizing this impact while still enjoying outdoor activities. This guide explores these principles and offers practical tips for implementation.

## The Seven Principles

### 1. Plan Ahead and Prepare

Proper planning not only ensures your safety but also helps minimize damage to natural resources.

**Key practices:**
- Research regulations and special concerns for the area
- Prepare for extreme weather, hazards, and emergencies
- Schedule your trip to avoid times of high use
- Use proper maps and know how to use a compass
- Repackage food to minimize waste
- Bring appropriate equipment for Leave No Trace practices

### 2. Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces

The goal is to prevent damage to land and waterways.

**In popular areas:**
- Concentrate use on existing trails and campsites
- Walk single file in the middle of the trail
- Keep campsites small and focused in areas where vegetation is absent

**In pristine areas:**
- Disperse use to prevent the creation of new campsites and trails
- Avoid places where impacts are just beginning to show
- Walk on durable surfaces such as rock, sand, gravel, dry grass

### 3. Dispose of Waste Properly

"Pack it in, pack it out" is a familiar mantra to seasoned wildland visitors.

**For human waste:**
- Deposit solid human waste in catholes 6-8 inches deep, at least 200 feet from water, camp, and trails
- Pack out toilet paper and hygiene products
- Use established toilets where available

**For other waste:**
- Pack out all trash, leftover food, and litter
- Wash dishes at least 200 feet from water sources
- Use small amounts of biodegradable soap
- Strain dishwater and scatter it

### 4. Leave What You Find

Allow others to experience a sense of discovery.

**Key practices:**
- Preserve the past: observe cultural artifacts but don't touch
- Leave rocks, plants, and other natural objects as you find them
- Avoid introducing or transporting non-native species
- Do not build structures or furniture, or dig trenches

### 5. Minimize Campfire Impacts

Campfires can cause lasting impacts to the environment.

**Key practices:**
- Use a lightweight stove for cooking instead of a fire
- Where fires are permitted, use established fire rings
- Keep fires small
- Burn only small sticks from the ground that can be broken by hand
- Burn all wood to ash, ensure the fire is completely out, and scatter cool ashes

### 6. Respect Wildlife

Observe wildlife from a distance and never feed animals.

**Key practices:**
- Control pets or leave them at home
- Avoid wildlife during sensitive times: mating, nesting, raising young, winter
- Store food and trash securely
- Never feed animals, which damages their health, alters natural behaviors, and exposes them to predators and other dangers

### 7. Be Considerate of Other Visitors

Be courteous and respect other visitors to maintain the quality of their experience.

**Key practices:**
- Yield to others on the trail
- Step to the downhill side when encountering pack stock
- Take breaks and camp away from trails and other visitors
- Let nature's sounds prevail by avoiding loud voices and noises
- Keep pets under control

## Applying Leave No Trace in Different Environments

### Alpine and Mountain Environments

- Stay on trails to prevent erosion in fragile alpine vegetation
- Camp below the tree line when possible
- Be aware of rockfall and avoid dislodging rocks

### Desert Environments

- Biological soil crusts are extremely fragile; stay on established paths
- Camp on durable surfaces like slickrock or sand
- Water sources are precious; avoid contaminating them

### Forest Environments

- Avoid trampling understory plants
- Be particularly careful with fire in forested areas
- Be aware of dead standing trees when selecting a campsite

### Water Environments (Lakes, Rivers, Coastal)

- Camp at least 200 feet from water sources
- Avoid trampling shoreline vegetation
- Use biodegradable soap sparingly and away from water sources

## Teaching Leave No Trace to Others

One of the most effective ways to promote Leave No Trace is to lead by example:

- Practice the principles yourself
- Gently share knowledge when appropriate
- Volunteer for trail maintenance and cleanup events
- Support organizations that promote outdoor ethics

## Conclusion

Leave No Trace is not about rules and regulationsâ€”it's about making good decisions to protect the natural world we love. By following these principles, we ensure that the beauty and integrity of outdoor spaces remain intact for current and future generations.

Remember that Leave No Trace is about minimizing impact, not eliminating it. The goal is to make thoughtful choices that reflect our respect for the natural world and other visitors.
