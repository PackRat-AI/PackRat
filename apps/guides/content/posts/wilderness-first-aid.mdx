# Wilderness First Aid Basics Every Hiker Should Know

When you're miles from the nearest road, medical help isn't just a phone call away. Wilderness first aid knowledge can be the difference between a minor inconvenience and a life-threatening emergency. This guide covers the essential skills every hiker should master.

## Preparation Before You Go

### First Aid Kit Essentials

A basic wilderness first aid kit should include:
